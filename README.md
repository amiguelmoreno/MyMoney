<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The main goal of this proyect is to use almost everything I have learnt about React, using a lot of main functionalities of React, Supabase and more.
<br />
<br />
### What did I learn this project?

  * React-router-dom
  * React-Query
  * Organized and clean code
  * Reusable components (Modal, Butttons, Inputs...)
  * Hooks
  * React-hook-form
  * ContextApi
  * Framer-motion


### What interesting components can I find?
    
   * Dashboard with visual graphics
     
   * List of transactions with a PRO Filter
    
   * Dark Mode
    

## Posible extra features and improvements

Some features I would like to add are:

 * Notifications when a certain limit of expenses or incomes is reached
 * Login (I didn't do it to let people see the project without login)
 * Functionality to download a PDF with the main info you want. 
 * Compress the size of the images reducing them to the maximum size used in the page
 * Use diferent size images for each media query to improve performance
